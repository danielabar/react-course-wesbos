# React Course with Wes Bos

## Thinking and Understanding React Components

Don't worry about views and models like other frameworks for now.

**Cmponent** Re-usable piece of website. React kind-of allows you to build your own tags. React dev tools shows components.

`App` is parent level component. React dev tools will show State. Changing state -> any component that depends on that portion of state is automatically updated, no need to explicitly select dom.

## Creating our First Components

To start will write in `index.js` then refactor to component file. Will build store picker component.

Weback takes in index.js and any files it requires and bundles it in one big js file `static/js/bundle.js`. Contains HMR code but that's only included for development, not production.

Start with importing React, then make a class. Best practice to start class names with capital.

Every class in React must have at least one method: `render`, which determines what dom elements should be rendered out to the page.

Need to _mount_ application for components to show up. This is the only time we touch the DOM directly.

Also need to import react-dom. Only need the `render` method from this package. Render needs some jsx and a mount point, a dom element to attach to:

```
render(<p>HEYYYYY!</p>, document.querySelector('#main'));
```

Since we made a StorePicker component, can use it as a tag and pass as first arg to render. Note self closing tag:

```javascript
render(<StorePicker />, document.querySelector("#main"));
```

Best practice is for each component to be stored in a separate file, eg: `src/components/StorePicker.js`. One way is to name the file the same as component class. Must export the class as default.

## Writing HTML with JSX

JSX allows mixing JavaScript and HTML in the same file. Not required to write React app, but most commonly used.

**JSX Gotchas**

- Use `className` instead of `class`.
- If returning multiple lines, wrap return in parens `()`, otherwise will break due to ASI.
- Cannot return sibling elements. Can only return one element - can be as many children inside as you like.
- For comments, use curly brackets and js comments `{ /* this is a comment */ }`
- Don't put comment outside of a tag though
- But if you need to return children with no wrapper (eg: flexbox), wrap with `<React.Fragment>`, which renders out to "nothing"

```javascript
import React from "react";

class StorePicker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <p>Fish!</p>
        <form className="store-picker">
          {/* this is a comment */}
          <h2>Please Enter A Store</h2>
        </form>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

export default StorePicker;
```

**To get Emmet working in VS Code with JSX**

```json
"emmet.syntaxProfiles": {
  "javascript": "jsx",
  "xml": {
    "attr_quotes": "single"
  }
},
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "javascript": "javascriptreact"
},
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
```

## Loading CSS into our React Application

A few different options. If integrating React into an existing app that already has css, edit `index.html` (or whatever if your app mounting point) and add a regular link tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

Another option is "componentized css" - rather than one big css file, import css directly into component, where the css only relates to that component.

Can also import css into `index.js`, then it's available to entire app:

```javascript
import "./css/style.css";
```

From create-react-app, weback is configured to hot reload any css changes.

## Creating our application layout with components

App component will hold ALL children that make up app. This allows us to share data and methods across components.

Create new file `src/components/App.js`

It imports Header, Order and Inventory components to create the main app layout.

## Passing Dynamic data with props

Similar to HTML attributes, eg: img tag must have `src` and `alt`. Provide more info to tag so that it can render to page. Props are the way we get data into a component.

Data will live in app and we need a way to pass it down to children components.

State is where the data lives and Props is how the data gets to where it needs to go. State === Home, Props === Car.

For example, want to make tagline in Header dynamic.

There are no preset props, just make up whatever you need. For example, in Header.js:

```javascript
<Header tagline="Wes is Cool" />
```

Then React dev tools will show that Header component has Props tagline: "Wes is Cool"

Props is like object of data that got passed in to component, kind of like arguments object in a function.

To pass in anything other than a string, use `{}`:

```javascript
<Header tagline="Wes is Cool" age={500} cool={true} />
```

To access the props in the component that received them, recall `{}` in JSX means "I'm going back to just regular old JavaScript"

```javascript
<span>{this.props.tagline}</span>
```

`this` is component instance (eg: Header). `.props` is object inside component that contains properties.

### React Devtools Trick

Click on any compoennt from React tab, shows `$r`. This is similar to `$0` from Elements tab but for React, will show you everything that's available on the component when enter `$r` in Console tab, eg: props.

## Stateless Functional Components

If component only has render function (and prop types) and nothing else, can use stateless functional components. It's just a function that returns jsx. Instead of `this.props.foo`, function gets passed `props` as argument, then can use `props.foo` inside jsx. Can use arrow function and implicit return. Example:

```javascript
import React from "react";

const Header = props => (
  <header className="top">
    <h1>
      Catch
      <span className="ofThe">
        <span className="of">of</span>
        <span className="of">the</span>
      </span>
      Day
    </h1>
    <h3 className="tagline">
      <span>{props.tagline}</span>
    </h3>
  </header>
);

export default Header;
```

**Optional**

Can also destructure props into variables:

```javascript
const Header = ({ tagline, age }) => (
  <header ClassName="top">
    <span>{tagline}</span>
    <span>{age}</span>
  </header>
);
```

## Routing with React Router

Need to install a separate package `react-router-dom`, not baked into React.

Note that Router is also a component. Create a new component `src/components/Router.js`. Use `react-router-dom` to get push state in browser.

Make `Router` a stateless functional component.

`Switch` tag tries each `Route` from top to bottom, if first one doesn't match, goes to second etc.

`Route` component takes props such as `exact` to match a path exactly, `path` the route to match, and `component` what component to load when route is matched. Last entry is "catch all" for anything that didn't match previously, for example, put 404 not found here. This is done by not specifying any `path` for `Route`.

```javascript
// Router.js
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import StorePicker from "./StorePicker";
import NotFound from "./NotFound";
import App from "./App";

const Router = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/" component={StorePicker} />
      <Route path="/store/:storeId" component={App} />
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
);

export default Router;
```

Must render `Router` component to mounting point to make use of it. Do this in `index.js`:

```javascript
// index.js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import Router from "./components/Router";
import "./css/style.css";

render(<Router />, document.querySelector("#main"));
```

**React Devtools Tips**

- Use Search bar to quickly find a component that could be nested deeply within structure.
- Clicking on component that is target of the router (eg: App), Props will show `match` property that contains routing details including `params`, which will have for example: `storeId: "123"`.

## Helper and Utility Functions

Not specific to React, but general good practice on js projects. For example, helper function to format money, or generate a random name. Can place all this in `helpers.js`, which is NOT a react component. Export each function, i.e. named export, not default export:

```javascript
// helpers.js
export function formatPrice(cents) {
  ...
}

export function getFunName() {
  ...
}
...
```

To make use of a helper function, for example in StorePicker component. When component mounts to page, will run `getFunName` function and use its return value as `defaultValue` for `input` tag.

Note use of input `defaultValue` rather than `value`. Because `value` must be attached to state, more on this topic later.

```javascript
// StorePicker.js
import React from "react";
import { getFunName } from "../helpers";

class StorePicker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form className="store-selector">
        <h2>Please Enter A Store</h2>
        <input
          type="text"
          required
          placeholder="Store Name"
          defaultValue={getFunName()}
        />
        <button type="submit">Visit Store -></button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default StorePicker;
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### :question: I'm getting error "Pre-built binaries not found for grpc@1.10.1 and node@10.3.0" and "Tried to download(403): https://storage.googleapis.com....."

One of the dependencies is currently not working with Node.js 10.3, please use [version 9.11.1](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v9.11.1/) (or around that, 8.x and 9.x should work fine) until then. Don't sweat this as it's just build tooling and isn't related to the version of react you are using.

#### :question: I tried installing the Babel syntax highlighter but it didn't work!

There are a few possible options:

- If you are on Sublime Text 2, you should Upgrade to Sublime Text 3.
- Some users have reported restarting works
- You can try the [JavaScript Next](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScriptNext%20-%20ES6%20Syntax) syntax highlighter instead

#### :question: I can't set Babel as the default syntax highlighter!

Make sure you are in a file with the extension of `.js` before you do this step - you can't set the default for a file without having a file open!

#### :question: I can't see the React tab in my dev tools

Restart your dev tools or your chrome browser entirely. They will only show up when you are viewing a React app - so make sure you test it on Facebook or another website that is running React. It won't work on your empty `main.js` file until you `import React from 'react'`.

#### :question: `npm start` doesn't update the app on file save, or doesn't run correctly.

There may be a few different causes for this:

- Webpack currently can't handle folder/file names that contain parentheses.
- Webpack also has problems running inside folders for Dropbox/Google Drive type services. Git is recommended for keeping your files in sync across multiple computers.

## Changes In the 2018 RE-Record

In March 2018 I re-recorded this course. Here are the things that I've updated.

- Upgrade to React Router 4 Final API
- Use React 16.3
- Move to external PropTypes Package
- Use React's new Refs API, remove function refs
- Remove all use of constructors and super() - use class properties instead
- Better explain binding, use of `this` and component instances
- Moved from React-addons-css-transition-group to react-transition-group and upgraded from 1.x to 2.x
- Use official Firebase package for Auth as re-base is now only for data binding
- Move promise based code to async/await
- Show how to return multiple elements with React.Fragment

## htaccess

Here is the .htaccess file we use in the apache deployment video

```
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```
